# CTFd-and-Container
This repository uses the plugin developed by TheFlash2k, their CTFd plugin. In this repository, we aim to provide a solution to the CGP firewall rules using a script that leverages its API.

For the less attentive, the purpose of this repository is to work on and explain how to achieve this. Basically, what we want to do is enable competitors to deploy their own challenge (in the form of a container) during the competition, ensuring each participant has their own instance. This approach is similar to how HTB labs work.

Attached is the link to TheFlash2k's repository: [https://github.com/TheFlash2k/containers](https://github.com/TheFlash2k/containers).

And of course, here is the link to the CTFd repository as well: [https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd).
